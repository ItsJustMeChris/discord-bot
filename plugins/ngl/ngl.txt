Faster than a spacecraft
Terrifying zombie
Enraged and like a craycraft
He's half man and half zombi

Master of mice I'm pulling your lever
Twisting your facts and smashing your plates
Blinded by me, you can't see the ever
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you fate
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you fate
Master
Master

Ten is the number of the zombie.

A rotten smelly foot nestled somewhere in time
A dirty villain - no warnings, no signs
Judgment day and the an ugly troll arrives
Eventually, they all commit crimes

The plates went SMACK, there was no use turning back
'Cause I just had to see, was a zombie watching me?
In the mist the facts twist
Was all this swell, or just some kind of hell?

Ten is the number of the zombie.

Is it the end, my friend?
Master you're going 'round the bend
Half man and half zombi
No, no, please, no
Ten ... ten
